#' Looped coordinates
#'
#' The looped coordinate system loops the cartesian coordinate system around
#' specific loop points. This is particularly useful for visualising seasonal
#' patterns that repeat over calendar periods, since the shape of seasonal
#' patterns can be more easily seen when superimposed on top of each other.
#'
#' @param loops Loop the time scale around a calendrical granularity, one of:
#'   - `NULL` or `waiver()` for no looping (the default)
#'   - A `mixtime` vector giving time points at which the `time` axis should loop
#'   - A function that takes the limits as input and returns loop points as output
#' @param time_loops A duration giving the distance between temporal
#' loops like "2 weeks", or "10 years". If both `loops` and `time_loops` are
#' specified, `time_loops` wins.
#' @param time A string specifying which aesthetic contains the time variable that
#'   should be looped over. Default is `"x"`.
#' @param ljust Loop justification, a number between 0 and 1
#'   indicating where the lines between looped positions are drawn
#'   (0 indicates left, 1 indicates right, 0.5 indicates center).
#' @param xlim,ylim Limits for the x and y axes. `NULL` means use the default limits.
#' @param expand Logical indicating whether to expand the coordinate limits.
#'   Default is `FALSE`.
#' @param default Logical indicating whether this is the default coordinate system.
#'   Default is `FALSE`.
#' @param clip Should drawing be clipped to the extent of the plot panel?
#'   A setting of `"on"` (the default) means yes, and a setting of `"off"` means no.
#' @param clip_loops Should the drawing of each loop of the timescale be clipped to
#'   the breaks defined by `time_loops` and `ljust`?
#'   A setting of `"on"` (the default) means yes, and a setting of `"off"` means no.
#' @param coord The underlying coordinate system to use. Default is `coord_cartesian()`.
#'
#' @details
#' This coordinate system is particularly useful for visualizing seasonal or
#' cyclic patterns in time series data. It works by:
#'
#' \enumerate{
#'   \item Dividing the time axis into segments based on the specified loop period
#'   \item Translating each segment to overlay on the first segment
#'   \item Creating a visualization where multiple time periods are superimposed
#' }
#'
#' The coordinate system requires R version 4.2.0 or higher due to its use of
#' usage of clipping paths.
#'
#' @section Practical usage:
#'
#' The looped coordinate system reveals patterns that repeat over regular time
#' periods, such as annual seasonality in monthly data, or weekly patterns in
#' daily data. It allows the `[x/y]` time aesthetic to be specified
#' continuously, and loops the time axis around specified time intervals. This
#' allows time within seasonal periods to be compared directly, and highlights
#' the shape of seasonal patterns. This is commonly used in time series analysis
#' to identify the peaks and troughs of seasonal patterns.
#'
#' A key advantage of time being specified continuously is that the connection
#' between the end of one seasonal period and the start of the next is
#' preserved. This is otherwise lost when time is discretised into ordered
#' factors (e.g. months of the year, or days of week). This allows lines and
#' other geometries to be drawn across seasonal boundaries, such as a line that
#' connects December to January when plotting annual seasonality.
#' The justification parameter `ljust` controls the side of the panel where
#' these connections are made, left justificiation (`ljust = 0`) gives space
#' for inter-seasonal time on the left of the panel, right justification
#' (`ljust = 1`) uses the right side of the panel, and center justification
#' (`ljust = 0.5`, the default) uses equal spacing on both ends of the season.
#'
#' @section Why not use seasonal factors?:
#'
#' Using factors to represent seasonal periods is common, but prone to errors
#' and is very limiting. Suppose you want to visualize weekly seasonality in
#' daily data. You could convert the date into a day of week factor (e.g. with
#' `lubridate::wday(date, label = TRUE)`), but this loses information about the
#' year and week of the observation. In order to correctly draw lines connecting
#' each day of the week (avoiding sawtooth patterns), you would additionally
#' need to group by year and week to separately identify each line segment. The
#' aesthetic mapping for plotting this pattern would look something like:
#'
#' ```
#' aes(
#'   x = lubridate::wday(date, label = TRUE),
#'   group = interaction(lubridate::year(date), lubridate::week(date)),
#'   y = value
#' )
#' ```
#'
#' These operations are error-prone, cumbersome, and are complicated to update
#' to show different seasonal patterns. For example, if you wanted to instead
#' show the annual seasonal pattern, both the `x` and `group` aesthetics would
#' need to be changed (to day of year and year respectively). Any errors in this
#' process would produce sawtooth patterns or other artifacts in the plot.
#'
#' Another common error in discretizing time into seasonal factors is
#' incorrect ordering of the factor levels. For example, if you instead used
#' `strftime(date, "%a")` to get the day of week, the levels would be sorted
#' alphabetically rather than in time order ("Fri", "Mon", "Sat", ...). No-one
#' wants to Monday to follow Friday!
#'
#' Discretizing time into seasonal factors also prevents plotting the seasonal
#' pattern across multiple granularities. For example when visualizing weekly
#' seasonality across data at daily and hourly frequencies, both day of week
#' and hour of week are needed. Since these factors have different levels, they
#' cannot be plotted on the same axis. In contrast, it is possible to plot both
#' daily and hourly data on the same axis using [scale_x_mixtime()], which can
#' then be looped over weekly periods with `coord_loop(time_loops = "1 week")`.
#'
#' Another subtle issue of using factors instead of continuous time is that
#' spacing between time points is regularized. For example, when plotting the
#' annual seasonal pattern with months as a factor, each month is given equal
#' width on the x-axis despite the fact that months have different lengths.

#' Specialize the implementation of coord_loop depending on the base coord

#' [coord_loop()] wraps a base coord such as [coord_cartesian()] or

#' instance for its underlying base coord by overriding methods needed to support
#' that base coord.
#' @param coord A [`ggproto`] object of class `CoordLoop`, which will inherit
#' from some other coord (as passed to `CoordLoop(coord = ...)`.
#' @param ... unused.
#' @details
#' Implement this method on a coord's class to provide support for that coord in
#' [coord_loop()] by returning.
#'
#' Specializations *must* implement:
#'
#' - `coord$time_scale`: The name of the time scale (e.g. `"x"`, `"y"`, ...):
#'   corresponds to the element of `panel_params` holding the `Scale` that
#'   handles time.
#'
#' Specializations *may need to* implement:
#'
#' - `coord$limits`: If the positional scales for this coord are not `x` and `y`
#'   (so `coord$time_scale` is not `"x"` or `"y"`), you may need to adjust
#'   `limits` to map limits from `xlim` and `ylim` onto the corresponding scales.
#' - `coord$transform()` and/or `coord$draw_panel()`: To transform coordinates
#'   into looped positions and/or transform grobs to create looping.
#'
#' We use a separate specialization function rather than making `CoordLoop()`
#' generic so that the default method of this generic can be an error
