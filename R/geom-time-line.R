#' Line geometry with temporal semantics
#'
#' @description
#' `geom_time_line()` connects observations in order of the time variable, similar to
#' [ggplot2::geom_line()], but with special handling for time zones, gaps and
#' duplicated values.
#'
#' The geometry helps to visualise time with changing time offsets provided by the
#' `[x/y]timeoffset` aesthetics. Changes in time offsets are drawn using dashed lines,
#' which are most commonly used for timezone changes and daylight savings time transitions.
#' Timezone offsets are automatically used when times from the `mixtime` package are used
#' in conjunction with [position_time_civil()] positioning (the default).
#'
#' This geometry also respects implicit missing values in regular time series, and will
#' not connect temporal observations separated by gaps.
#'
#' The [ggplot2::group] aesthetic determines which cases are connected together.
#'
#' @aesthetics GeomTimeLine
#' @inheritParams ggplot2::layer
#' @inheritParams ggplot2::geom_line
#' @param inherit.aes If `FALSE`, overrides the default aesthetics, rather than
#'  combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions that define both
#'  data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from the default plot specification.
#' @param ... Other arguments passed on to [ggplot2::geom_line()].
#'
#' @seealso
#'  [position_time_civil()]/[position_time_absolute()] for civil and absolute time positioning.
#'
#'  [ggplot2::geom_line()]/[ggplot2::geom_path()] for standard line/path geoms in ggplot2.
#'
#' @section Practical usage:
#'
#' The `geom_time_line()` geometry extends [ggplot2::geom_line()] with time
#' semantics that ensure the line's slope accurately reflects rates of change in
#' the measurements over time.
#'
#'
#' Most notably, `geom_time_line()` works closely with [position_time_civil()]
#' and [position_time_absolute()] to correctly display time in civil and
#' absolute time formats, respectively. Civil time positioning (the default)
#' shows time as experienced in a specific timezone (also known as 'local time',
#' it is the time on clocks in that timezone). Absolute time positioning shows
#' time as a continuous timeline without timezone adjustments.
#'
#'
#' When time series are visualised in civil time, timezone offset changes (e.g.
#' due to daylight saving time) cause 'jumps' in time which are indicated with
#' dashed lines. This preserves the integrity of the line's slope across these
#' transitions. Another benefit of visualising time series in civil time is to
#' compare time series across different timezones, as the time axis is better
#' aligned with human behaviour in their local timezone (e.g. working hours,
#' sleep patterns, etc). Plotting time series in *absolute time* shows the exact
#' contemporaneous timing of events across multiple timezones, which is useful
#' when resources or patterns are shared across timezones (e.g. international
#' markets, server load balancing, etc).
#'
#'
#' This geometry also maintains semantically valid slopes when time values are
#' missing (either implicitly or explicitly), or duplicated. Implicit missing
#' values in regular time series are semantically equivalent to explicit missing
#' values, and `geom_time_line()` since the slope between unkown values is also
#' unknown, `geom_time_line()` will not draw lines connecting missing values of
#' either type. Since duplicated time values are not semantically valid in
#' regular time series, `geom_time_line()` will issue a warning (or an error if
#' systematic duplicates are detected). When drawing a line between duplicated
#' time points, the correct slopes are drawn by connecting all lines that lead
#' to and from the duplicated time points (rather than drawing sawtooth lines).
#'
#'
# #' Using `geom_time_line()` instead of `geom_line()` for visualising time series
# # ' data...
#'
#' Further details about each specific capability are described in the following
#' sections.
#'
#' @section Changing time offsets:
#'
#' The `xtimeoffset` and `ytimeoffset` aesthetics allow for visualization of time
#' offset changes, such as timezone transitions or daylight saving time changes.
#' When successive time offsets differ, a dashed line segment is drawn to show
#' the offset transition. These aesthetics are automatically set when using
#' `position` = [position_time_civil()] (the default), however the offsets can
#' also be set manually to show other types of time offsets. One example of when
#' it is useful to set the offsets manually is when showing measurements from a
#' sensor with a known time drift (e.g. a clock that runs fast or slow) that is
#' re-calibrated at known times.
#'
#' @section Missing time values:
#'
#' Explicit missing values are where an `NA` value is included in the data, but
#' for regular time series it is also possible to identify implicit missing time
#' values. Unlike [ggplot2::geom_line()], `geom_time_line()` will also not connect
#' points separated by implicit missing values, creating gaps in the line (just
#' like when an explicit missing value is present in [ggplot2::geom_line()]).
#'
#' @section Duplicated time values:
#'
#' If there are duplicated time values within a group, `geom_time_line()` will
#' issue a warning. An error will be raised if these duplications are systematic
#' across the geometry, specifically if more than 50% of time points contain the
#' same number of duplicates. Systematic duplicates typically indicate a need to
#' use grouping aesthetics ([ggplot2::group], or [ggplot2::colour]) to
#' draw separate lines for each time series. Rather than plotting an erroneous
#' 'sawtooth' line which misrepresents the rate of change, the geometry will
#' draw all lines that connect to and from each of the duplicated time values.
